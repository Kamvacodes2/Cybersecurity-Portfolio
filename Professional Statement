My Goals are to improve my analytical thinking skills, to effectively understand a cyber security threat and recommend and apply the best solution at that moment.

To confidently communicate strategies that would help ensure the company is well prepared for cyberthreats and be persuasive in my communication abilities.

Furthermore I want to improve my proficiency when it comes to programming in python, to able to automate and script beneficial and easy to use programs


What motivates me is ensuring the organization is protected against threats and we adhere to the regulatory compliance measures. Data is so important in this day and age and the protection of it should be upheld. People trust us with their private information and it's only right that we do our best to uphold that information's integrity and safeguarding.

Iâ€™m really excited about this particular industry. It has become one of the fastest growing and is more prevalent in this day and age. It presents one the ability to architect safeguards and structures and tackle challenging scenarios. It allows us to better understand how data can be secured and provide one of the most important services of this day and age. Data integrity and protection.
